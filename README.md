# HHV6 Reactivation
Repository for reproducing analyses related to HHV-6 reactivation in CAR T cells manuscript.

## Reproducibility

### Figure 1

- [This repository](https://github.com/caleblareau/serratus-reactivation-screen) contains files to reproduce Serratus screening analyses for all viruses (via ViralZone) known to infect humans (see panels b,c). Note: due to the large number of `.soft` files annotating the GSM samples, it made sense to make this a separate repository.
