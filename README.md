# HHV6 Reactivation
Repository for reproducing analyses related to HHV-6 reactivation in CAR T cells manuscript.

## Reproducibility

### Figure 1
- [This repository](https://github.com/caleblareau/serratus-reactivation-screen) contains files to reproduce Serratus screening analyses for all viruses (via ViralZone) known to infect humans (see panels b,c). Note: due to the large number of `.soft` files annotating the GSM samples, it made sense to make this a separate repository.
- Code to reproduce the followup and supplemental analyses panels are contained in [this subfolder](https://github.com/caleblareau/hhv6-reactivation/tree/main/public_bulk_data).

### Figure 2
- All code to reproduce the analysis figure panels are contained in [this subfolder](https://github.com/caleblareau/hhv6-reactivation/tree/main/single_cell_data/stanford-invitro/code).

### Figure 3
- All code to reproduce the analysis figure panels are contained in [this subfolder](https://github.com/caleblareau/hhv6-reactivation/tree/main/single_cell_data/broad-invivo/code).


### HHV6 reference genome

For both ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets, we use the genome / transcriptome of HHV-6B available here:
