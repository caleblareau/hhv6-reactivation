### A few notes on the kallisto equivalence classes

The `matrix.ec` file maps the 3rd column in the .txt files to the specific transcripts (transcripts.txt) based on regions of homology or not

An example pseudobulk file (from running kallisto but ignoring the cell/umi stuff) shows the effective length which is good for knowing what genes could gene be quantified
